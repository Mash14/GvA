					"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
					men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of
					the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
					and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those
					who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
					saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
					simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of
					choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do
					what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
					avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty
					or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures
					have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
					always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he
					rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he
					endures pains to avoid worse pains."
