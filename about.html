				"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
				men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
				moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
				trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
				fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
				through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple
				and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
				untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
				best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
				certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
				of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
				repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds
				in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
				secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
				pains."
